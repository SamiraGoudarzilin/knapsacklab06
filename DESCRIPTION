Description: The package will contain three different functions for solving what is called the knapsack problem.
        The knapsack problem is a discrete optimization problem where we have a knapsack that can take a
        limited weight W and we want to fill this knapsack with a number of items i = 1,...,n, each with a
        weight w and a value v. The goal is to find the knapsack with the largest value of the elements added
        to the knapsack..
